# MT4599-Codes
Codes used during the writing of my MT4599 project for my undergraduate degree at the University of St Andrews. The project is an overview of the electric guitar from an applied maths perspective, where I study the motion of a plucked string, the resulting requencies, the infulence of the magnetic fields on the sounds produced and the underlying mathematics of these processes.
